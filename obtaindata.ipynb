WE GOING UP TOMMOROW FAM. \\n\\n\\n**INCOMING TENDIES ALERT**\\n\\n*WEE WOO WEE WOO *\\n\\n**INCOMING TENDIES ALERT** But but but... Quite a number of analysis mentioned that Apple is not able to sell iPhone X as much as they want. Couldn\\'t find this on their website, but it\\'s apparently their cover for tomorrow: https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/957714460424200193/photo/1 What is this? The Faggot Times? No one cares.\\n\\n2 smokes lets go. Hopefully this means OLED will bounce back too.  now its going to be priced in way to go wsb you just cant win AAPL to the MOON this week!!! LETS GO BABY It\\'s all about guidance at this point. so WHY THE FUCK is it still falling... My poor poor long positions place at close Friyay Anddd it\\'s down $3  lol. It says \"set to beat\", obviously those are the expectations, reality might be different Cool. What about AAPL though? I could not have been more. Wrong Faggot times>bullshit analysts Apple probably wants to sell all of them. The profit margin on the X is probably so insane that they could miss their sales estimates by half and still break a record. It\\'s the financial times and all the British read it.  It\\'s supposed to be very accurate Fuck you ricky Half of wsb including me is balls deep in AAPL or QQQ Mod wrote appl, he can\\'t even get the ticker symbol right. Why trust his intuition? The only equation you’ll ever need 👌 The profit margins are massive and if they lower prices slightly, all the plebs would buy it. Long Apple The same british who chose Brexit? I don\\'t take advice from retards thx  I stuffed the balls in as well. Since OP’s became Mods! Literally, no You’re in the wrong sub bub \\U0001f92b💸 Ft where massively against brexitting  Apple getting cored. Where is that dude with 40k in APPL calls? Everything is tanking I’d really like to hear someone’s bear case scenario. \\n\\nI’m an idiot but the way I see it:\\nApple basically the only FANG stock to not participate in the rally of the last 2 weeks. \\n\\nApple has a history of flat stock performance and then major breakouts at and shortly after earnings. Exact setup as now. \\n\\nCook just announced all the stuff with repatriation, hiring 20k, planning new campus, bonuses to employees. - you don’t do this prior to missing earnings expectations. \\n\\nI see no slowdown in phone sales. People printing money in the stock market and businesses are pushing out bonuses. Don’t think these are going to new phones?\\n\\nDisclosure: long stock and calls  BUY BUY BUY! If apple tanks more I\\'ll be rich so don\\'t worry it wont,..\\n\\nI bought 7 puts 162.5 strike! \\n\\nSo go ahead apple and make my day Probably holding  They like to bleed out the bulls before next catalyst.   They bled out the gains post iPhone X release.  Then pow the repatriation tax pop.   Now time to bleed that until earnings are confirmed. \\n\\nThey could also be reallocating to stuff that they expect to run more. Stuff that’s more beaten down and poised.   Energy, for example.   the ticker for apple is AAPL you dumbfuck My cash money is screaming to get in- should I get calls or equity Which one of you smart fellers has thoughts to share re: an entry point? Edit. Meant to reply to comment.  wednesday is the new turdsday  \"I see no slowdown in iphone sales.\"  \\n\\nWhat exactly are your sources? \\n\\nAlso, Apple is getting slaughtered in China.  How long do you plan on holding? Short term: calls, long term: equity And Thursday is the new Thursday  I get it. This is my opinion and obviously anecdotal on my part. I don’t see it in my daily life. Maybe I’m wrong. \\n\\nI get that you’re referencing the channel check report of an analyst and their sales went from like 47b to 45b in China last quarter. I don’t really see that as an issue at all. \\n\\nMy bigger point is that there is no way Cook comes out 3 weeks before earnings passing out the goodies and then they blow the earnings.  \\n\\nMaybe I’m wrong and I’ll sell my calls and take a loss. Just don’t see it happening and feels crystal clear to me.  By short term, do you mean anything less than3 months?  or LEAPS for long term. I\\'m up 20-30% on Jan \\'19 calls after holding for like 2 days Double dip recession confirmed Y u has to say that Yea I\\'m holding for tomorrow for those sweet dip gainz\\n And Monday is the new Thursday. And Friday is the new Thursday. And. You get it  I mean....I hope APPL crushes and raises guidance, but China is not going to be kind to them and I think they will only lag further behind there.  \\n\\nWhere I think APPL will surprise and shine is with services.  Yes Appl, Alphabet, Amzn earnings call discussion I brought Amazon at 11 today, it\\'s trading during the day nearly killed me but the earnings were hot  Google \\n\\nEarnings per share: $9.70 vs $9.98 expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate\\n\\nRevenue: $32.32 billion vs $31.86 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Amzn just killed it Waiting on 🍎 Apple  Where’s the love for $V??? I\\'m long AMZN, so I didn\\'t care much about the loss today anyway. But then those after hour prices kicked in after the earnings report, I can\\'t complain! How much did you buy To recap\\nAmzn= beat earnings, increased guidance\\nAppl= beat earnings, lowered guidance\\nGoogl= missed and lowered Amazon Q4 17 Earnings Results:\\n-Adj EPS: $3.75 (Estimate $1.85)\\n-Revenue: $60.5B (Estimate $59.85B) apple 3.89 vs 3.86, price took a hit )-: Visa beat as well\\n\\nLooking for the numbers 5 shares, not alot Ik but enough to make a fee extra hundred. Capped off a nice day overall  it\\'s bouncing around. Correct\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s results are out. Revenue of $88.29B beats an $87.5B consensus. EPS of $3.89 beats a $3.85 consensus. beat 1.08 vs 1.00, but it still went down, shit )-: \\n\\nstill up on total return, but was hoping for a small bump after the bloodbath this week Also have five shares $1,419 average. Just enjoying the ride.  Hoping the guidance will blow shit out the water, I need to make up all the losses from this week )-:\\n\\nedit: jk guidance is terrible its over boys.  Which companies would make sense APPL to acquire? MU. Think about it. \\n\\nApples + chips = perfect snack.  corning Pornhub  AAPL SPY SQ GoPro.  Blackberry, Corning, Square, Energous, and HTC\\n\\n\\nEdit: Scratch HTC.. looks like Google jumped on that GOOG AMD. Qualcomm One of these new chinese electric car manufactures. Also Corning seems fitting stonks Apple is notorious for NOT buying companies. So none. Netflix. Only reasonable company mentioned.  Honestly though....I wonder how profitable a subscription based porn site like Brazzers or Naughty America makes. Shut the fuck up you faggot.  A fuck ton iTunes for video. Who pays for porn? People who can afford to actually go fuck themselves. Which companies would make sense APPL to acquire? People have talked about \"Apple gonna buy\", \"Apple should buy\" etc for years now. None of the various rumors about major purchases have come true.\\n\\nIf I have to throw out something - and I have next-to-no belief that this will actually happen - I\\'ll say that Apple should actually ponder ILMN and ILMN spin-off \"DNA App store\" Helix (http://www.businessinsider.com/helix-launches-app-store-for-genetics-2017-7) Small companies who are working on things that would distinguish the iOS devices/Macs more if they were exclusive to them. Not sure who those names are, but that\\'s the best bet. They just bought Shazam a month ago for $400,000,000. What makes you think they are going to buy something else in the near future? Lqmt to make small wearables or fabricate car parts Shopify? Itself I doubt Appell Petroleum ($APPL) has the wherewithall to be buying anybody.\\n Tesla  GoPro\\nYext\\nSpotify  Sony\\n\\n-Has a studio\\n\\n-Gaming and VR\\n\\n-Consumer Electronics\\n\\n-R&D/Patents\\n\\n-Brand synergy\\n\\n-Undervalued Netflix. Now they will repatriate billions of dollars. It is not the same scenario. Yeah, Apple would be acquiring small companies in the millions of dollars range to speed up development of specific features.  I don\\'t think they\\'ll acquire any established companies. AMD? Repatriated billions of dollars. I see apple potentially buying divisions/certain assets of Sony and also having zero interest in the entirety.  Netflix is way too pricy and it would be unlike Apple to blow $150 billion on an acquisition  Why? Why? Never. They have their own in house chip design team which is world class. Why would they buy AMD? For all we know, Apple will transition away from x86 to ARM in their laptops in the next 5 years.  That shouldn\\'t matter too much, they could have always just used debt financing which was probably below the returns on their cash position anyway.  I think the whole company has value for Apple. Especially the studio, the gaming division and the consumer electronics business that could add a bunch of Siri integrated products.  iTunes for video. For 2015 meme stock  Why do they need to buy Netflix for that, they can buy something like Viacom for less and get a bigger library of content. Because Netflix is aligned with Apple business model. In which way? Internet or something like that Anyone else shorting appl with me ? Go for it..\\n\\nI bought today at 166\\n\\nThey have done 80 billion in revenue this past quarter, and 30 billion in iPhone X sales in 2 months\\n\\nApple just pulled back 6% over the past week, do you really think it’s gonna drop more. 158 is like a 12% drop from where they were trading at a week ago or so. There might be a technical scream at 158 but fundamentally, apple is going over 200 this year.  Everyday, an idiot is born and today is no different.  This will probably hit $180+ this week. Let us know how that goes, /u/retardedinvestor, you have bigger balls than I.  Hahaha omg Name checks out Long at this price. Shorting a tech stock with a PE of 18 that took a 6% dip this week in a bull market might not be the best idea, ha. Technicals also screaming support at 165. Its a bull market, you’ll get burnt more often than not trying to predict tops. Pft, yeah tell me how that goes Yes, in @ 170 for 25 shares  I am shorting! considering the market topped a few days go , even with any kinda earning this is bound to go down.\\nQQQ is way overbought Im sure nasdaq will pull back to 7000 to 7150 in short term only my mom can call me an idiot! Its a 850 billion company. At that market cap along with all the rumors and downgrade if the earning isn\\'t perfectly perfect this will test 155$ in a hurry and crash the whole qqq  ( not a crash but a cute little 5%  to 7% correction).\\nI\\'m playing it short-term.  Long term Apple is a solid company and I totally agree with you .but right now it\\'s way ahead of itself. \\n Watch and learn young grass hopper  There\\'s still bunch of big names lined up for tomorrow and next week to help/hurt qqq Don\\'t forget the one time tax payment( new us tax law) so many companies crashed after beating and raising the guidance after reporting a shitty earning due to the one time tax payment on foreign earning .\\nApple will be the next one ( and other tech giants as well) International Summer Course in Modern Icelandic! (Deadline for appl. Feb 15) I worked as the student assistant for both sessions last summer (the Nordplus group, for students from the Nordic countries, as well as the international group). As far as I could tell everyone seemed to have a great experience, Scandos as well as international-os. It was just as fun for me in its own right. I don\\'t know if I\\'m working in the same capacity this summer, but if anyone\\'s thinking of applying and has any questions, feel free to PM me :)  Wow that\\'s so cool! I have a lot of questions, haha, I sent you a PM :) How many students were in the study group last summer? APPL Music: autoplay with Siri after song selection? Maybe the problem is that your using APPL music instead of Apple music. But seriously, If you want Apple music to keep playing similar music just tell Siri to \"create a radio station off of this song\" while it\\'s playing or click the \"...\" and then click create radio station.  it\\'s just that on iTunes (*shudders*) on my PC when i pick it a song it will autoplay after the song ends, instead of me taking an extra step every time i pick an individual song then ask siri to curate a station. I\\'ve seen that point made plenty of times on here, and what it always boils down to is preference. And at the end of the day there is a button to do what you want and a button to do what I want. But if you get your way, my way can\\'t exist (and don\\'t say Apple could add a preference, because we know that\\'s not their style).  Well it’s doing what you want, have your tried saying “play *song name* radio not here to argue good sir\\n\\njust seems logical or even natural to have something followed up after an individual song selection automatically instead of silence. \\n\\nLike I said, I even turned down GPM and Spotify for Apple Music due to Siri integration, but I\\'m finding it\\'s not a very great integration compared to my 6 years with Google services...but alas, I dug myself too deep into this Apple ecosystem to go back any time soon. gave this a try few times, didn\\'t seem to work for me Who\\'s arguing? I do know you can hit the three little dots and it should have a button for \"start a radio \"\\n\\nI tend to just ask siri to play me some music and let it play that personalized radio station\\n\\nI wonder if play \"artist name\" radio would work.  I know it does for google play just never tried on apple music\\n\\n > But if you get your way, my way can\\'t exist \\n\\nsomething about not being able to cater to two different want  led me to believe there was a disagreement *shrugs*\\n\\n Thoughts on $APPL? I am holding Apple for the foreseeable future. Even if the sp growth is not as wild as i would like it to be, the potential for a special dividend on top of the regular dividend should ensure that at the very least Apple beats the broader market. Short for next 3-5 months. You’re welcome.  I\\'m new to this. What does Shorting mean? Shorting is when you borrow stocks, sell them immediately, then hope the stock goes down so you repay the stocks at a lower price. Basically, he thinks Apple will decline in value over the next 3-5 months.\\n\\nIf you\\'re new to stocks, don\\'t short. It\\'s definitely not beginner friendly. Ya borrowing sounds weird haha  APPL buyback >Hello!\\n\\nHi\\n\\n> Trying to judge when Apple is going to buy back stock this year.\\n\\nIt\\'s not hard to tell, it\\'s impossible.\\n\\n> Is there a way I can see when the date of their previous buybacks?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\n> or less likely any projection on when it will happen this year\\n\\nNo way to tell.\\n\\n> Anything else I should look into?\\n\\nBuy low, sell high. They\\'re probably already doing it.\\n\\nThere\\'s no way to tell who is buying AAPL\\'s stock. It could be retail investors, institutional investors, or AAPL themselves. They are only required to disclose it quarterly when they report the number of shares outstanding.\\n\\nMany times the buyback has already happened by the time a company announces it. And when a company does announce it, you should treat it like it\\'s already happened even if it hasn\\'t. a simple no would have sufficed  APPL vs BTC  [Here is the link to the original comment thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7r3ro8/appl_vs_btc) Or you can comment here to start a discussion. **Author**:  _projKe_ Loweffort- Panic Sell APPL Stock This is quality.
